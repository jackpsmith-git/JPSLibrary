# JPS Library
The JPS library is my own personal library for common methods that I use across my .NET projects. The JPS library is free and open-source software (FOSS) published under the MIT License. See LICENSE.txt for details. 
<p>&nbsp</p>

## Description
This library contains methods that I find useful across many .NET applications. It is constantly growing with new namespaces, classes, and methods, so be sure to check back frequently for updates. 
<p>&nbsp</p>

## Getting Started
You can find the compiled library in the JPS.dll file at the root of the repository. To use the library, add the .dll file to your solution and add a project referemce to the library.
